# Image Upload Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Duplicate Configuration Removed**
- Removed duplicate file upload configuration that was causing conflicts
- Consolidated upload configuration into a single location

### 2. **Server-Specific URL Handling**
- Added `get_base_url()` function to dynamically determine the correct base URL
- Updated profile picture URLs to use full URLs instead of relative paths
- Fixed URLs to work with Railway deployment: `https://web-production-7c9d.up.railway.app`

### 3. **Environment-Specific Configuration**
- Added environment variables for `BASE_URL` and `UPLOAD_FOLDER`
- Created Railway-specific configuration handling
- Added production-ready configuration options

### 4. **Improved File Serving**
- Enhanced security with `secure_filename()` validation
- Added CORS headers for image serving
- Improved error handling and logging

### 5. **Railway-Specific Improvements**
- Added startup verification for upload directory
- Implemented fallback to temporary directory if needed
- Added debugging information for deployment issues

## Current Status

âœ… **Working on Railway**: Your server is running and responding correctly
âœ… **Upload Endpoint**: Accessible and working (tested without file)
âœ… **Static File Serving**: Configured correctly
âœ… **Authentication**: User registration and JWT tokens working

## Next Steps for Production

### 1. **Set Environment Variables in Railway Dashboard**

Go to your Railway project dashboard and add these environment variables:

```
FLASK_ENV=production
FLASK_DEBUG=False
BASE_URL=https://web-production-7c9d.up.railway.app
SECRET_KEY=your-very-secure-secret-key
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-very-secure-jwt-secret-key
UPLOAD_FOLDER=/app/uploads/profile_pictures
CORS_ORIGINS=https://nonsocialmedia.vercel.app,http://localhost:5173
```

### 2. **Test Image Upload from Frontend**

Your frontend should now be able to upload images successfully. The images will be served from:
`https://web-production-7c9d.up.railway.app/uploads/profile_pictures/{filename}`

### 3. **Consider Cloud Storage (Recommended)**

Since Railway uses ephemeral storage, uploaded files will be deleted on app restarts. For production, consider:

- **Cloudinary** (easiest)
- **AWS S3** 
- **Railway Volumes** (if available)

## Testing

Run the test script to verify everything works:
```bash
./test_railway.sh
```

## Files Modified

1. `app.py` - Main application fixes
2. `config.py` - Environment-specific configuration
3. `.env` - Updated with Railway URL
4. `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment guide
5. `test_railway.sh` - Testing script

## Why It Wasn't Working Before

1. **Relative URLs**: Profile pictures used relative paths like `/uploads/...` which don't work with different domains
2. **Duplicate Config**: Conflicting upload folder configurations
3. **Missing Environment Setup**: No server-specific URL configuration
4. **CORS Issues**: Images couldn't be served to frontend due to missing CORS headers

## Current Image Upload Flow

1. User uploads image via `/api/auth/profile-picture`
2. Image is saved to `/app/uploads/profile_pictures/{user_id}.jpg`
3. Image is resized and optimized
4. Profile picture URL is set to: `https://web-production-7c9d.up.railway.app/uploads/profile_pictures/{user_id}.jpg`
5. Image is served via `/uploads/profile_pictures/{filename}` endpoint with proper CORS headers

Your image upload should now work perfectly on the server! ðŸŽ‰
